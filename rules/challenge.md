BrandAI: Build the AI That Critiques, Improves, and Trusts AI-Generated Ads
Track: VC big bets

Why This Title?
Millions of ads are being generated by AI — but almost none are deployed at scale without human review. Why? Because brands don’t trust AI to stay on-message, avoid harmful content, or follow visual identity guidelines. Full automation is impossible unless AI can judge its own output.
This challenge is about building not the generator, but the brain behind it — an AI critique model that evaluates whether an AI-generated ad is on-brand, safe, high-quality, and ready to post automatically. Think of it as training the AI version of a Creative Director + Brand Compliance Officer.

1. Goals and Motivation
   To automate marketing content at scale — whether for Instagram, YouTube Shorts, TikTok or e-commerce — AI must be able to generate ads and know if they are good, safe, and aligned with brand values.
   Today, AI-generated content fails at scale because:
   There is no reliable quality control for visuals, messaging, ethics or brand misuse.

AI-generated videos may include incorrect logos, copyright violations, biased content, unsafe scenes or off-brand messaging.

Companies cannot allow AI to post directly to social media without human review — there is no trust layer.

This challenge invites you to build:
An AI system that generates a short ad, critiques it using brand rules, scores it, and improves it automatically.
Generation is secondary — the critique model is the core innovation.

2. Core Features — Focus on the Hero Feature (AI Critique Engine)
   Teams should focus on building one hero feature extremely well.
   Hero Feature: Brand & Quality Critique Model
   This AI system should:
   Take an AI-generated image or video ad as input.

Evaluate it across dimensions such as:

Brand alignment (color palette, logo usage, tone of voice)

Visual quality (blurriness, composition, watermarking, artifacts)

Message clarity (is the product obvious? is the tagline correct?)

Safety & ethics (no harmful content, stereotypes, misleading claims)

Output a structured scorecard + JSON feedback.

Optionally, trigger regeneration with improved prompts.

Minimal Video Generation Functionality
Use existing models (e.g. Google Veo, Pika Labs, Runway, Stable Video Diffusion, Imagen Video).

Generate a basic 5–15 second ad clip using brand logo + product image + brief prompt.

This step should be lightweight — the focus is on evaluating the output, not building new video models.

Scoring
Define scores: BrandFit (0–1), VisualQuality (0–1), Safety (0–1), Clarity (0–1)

Example Gemini Prompt (For Critique Model)
You are a brand quality evaluator for Nike.
Given this video frame and caption, score:

1. Brand alignment (0-1)
2. Visual quality (0-1)
3. Tone accuracy (0-1)
4. Any violations or off-brand elements

Output as JSON only.

5. Why It Matters
   If AI is ever going to automatically run Instagram ads, TikTok campaigns, or YouTube promotions without human supervision, it must be able to judge its own output.
   This is not a challenge about making ads — it’s about trust in AI creativity.
   Without strong quality control:
   Brands risk publishing harmful or misleading content.

Consumers lose trust.

AI gets stuck generating drafts — never approved, never deployed.

With a well-designed critique engine:
AI can create safe, brand-aligned, high-quality ads autonomously.

Marketing becomes scalable, personalized, and continuous.

AI becomes a real "creative director," not just a tool.
